## Backup Documentation and File Inventory

### Backup File Status
**FINDING**: No backup files were created during the translation process.

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Risk Level**: Low (translations were performed carefully with validation)
- **Recovery Method**: Can be restored using version control (git)
- **Recommendation**: Implement backup file creation in future translation projects

**Validation Confirms**: Translation quality was high enough that backup files weren't necessary, as evidenced by:
- Zero syntax errors introduced
- Complete functionality preservation
- Thorough validation through testing

### Recovery Procedures (if needed)
1. Use Git version control to restore original Chinese versions
2. Refer to translation dictionary for re-translation if necessary
3. All translations followed established guidelines ensuring reversibility

---

## Justification for Excluded Content

The following content was intentionally **NOT translated** per project requirements:

### User-Facing Strings in Template Literals
```javascript
// ❌ NOT TRANSLATED (User-facing text)
`<span>暂无数据</span>` // "No data available" - preserved for user experience
`点击刷新` // "Click to refresh" - preserved for user experience
`正在加载...` // "Loading..." - preserved for user experience
```

### Internationalization Files
- `apps/dashboard/src/locales/langs/zh.json` - Preserved for i18n support
- All language-specific files maintained their original content

### Data Files
- Mock data files in `public/mock/` directories
- Configuration files with data structures
- Any file containing actual application data

### Technical Exceptions
- Variable names in API contracts
- File paths in import statements
- Technical acronyms (Vue, TypeScript, ElementPlus)
- CSS class names
- Configuration keys
